Why didn''t Fred and George ever say something about Ron being with a man named Peter throughout book 1 and 2? The final book also wasn''t as good of a payoff either. The hallows just came out of nowhere, instead of focusing on the horcruxes like it should''ve (in my opinion). I still enjoyed reading it when I first read it as a non-enthusiast, but as the years went on I began to not like it as much.

I’ve read ‘The Awakening’, ‘Huckleberry Finn’, ‘Wuthering Heights’, ‘The Grapes of Wrath’, ‘The Great Gatsby’, and so many more well-written, poignant novels. But East of Eden won’t leave me.

The intricacy of the plot, the depth of the characters, and the all-encompassing portrait of the foreign planet “Gethen”, complete with its own societal constructs, religion, and different nations, make this work a true MASTERPIECE of science fiction. I don’t want to take anything away from other great science fiction works like Dune or Ender’s Game or The Lord of the Rings, etc, etc, but TLHOD is not has a great plot, but it has great allegory; it really makes you think about how your life is shaped by things like societal norms, weather, “truth”, relationships, religion, and most importantly gender. The writing is so intentional with every sentence, and it only gets more complex with every re-read. Le Guin deserves every word of the praise that she gets, but the praise that she gets isn’t even half of what she deserves.');
